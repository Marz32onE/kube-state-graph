## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Centralised VictoriaMetrics as the only topology source

The topology reader SHALL fetch all pod, node, and PVC topology by issuing PromQL queries against a single configurable Prometheus-compatible endpoint (`--prom-url`), pointing at centralised VictoriaMetrics. The reader SHALL NOT call the Kubernetes API server, SHALL NOT scrape `kube-state-metrics` directly, and SHALL NOT use Kubernetes informers.

#### Scenario: Single configured upstream

- **WHEN** the server starts with `--prom-url=http://vm.example:8428`
- **THEN** every topology query is sent to `http://vm.example:8428` and no other HTTP destinations

#### Scenario: No Kubernetes API access

- **WHEN** the server runs in any environment
- **THEN** the binary makes no requests to any `/api/*` Kubernetes API path and requires no Kubernetes ServiceAccount or kubeconfig

### Requirement: Topology series consumed

The topology reader SHALL consume at minimum the following `kube-state-metrics` series, each carrying a `cluster` external label:

- `kube_pod_info{cluster, namespace, pod, uid, node, ...}`
- `kube_node_info{cluster, node, ...}`
- `kube_node_status_addresses{cluster, node, type="ExternalIP", address, ...}`
- `kube_pod_spec_volumes_persistentvolumeclaims_info{cluster, namespace, pod, volume, claim_name, ...}`
- `kube_node_labels{cluster, node, label_*, ...}`

#### Scenario: All families queried

- **WHEN** a graph build runs against an upstream containing all five families above
- **THEN** the reader emits exactly one PromQL query per family for the build, each evaluated at the bucketed `end` over the bucketed window

#### Scenario: Missing optional family

- **WHEN** the upstream contains `kube_pod_info` and `kube_node_info` but no `kube_node_labels` series for the window
- **THEN** the reader produces a valid topology with empty `labels` maps on node entities and does not fail the build

### Requirement: Time-window evaluation

Each topology query SHALL be evaluated at the bucketed `end` timestamp using `last_over_time(<series>[<window>]) @ <end>` so the result reflects the most recent value of each series within the requested window. The reader SHALL NOT fall back to instant evaluation at `now`.

#### Scenario: last_over_time used for kube_pod_info

- **WHEN** the reader runs a query for `kube_pod_info`
- **THEN** the issued PromQL string contains `last_over_time(kube_pod_info[<window>]) @ <end>` where `<window>` equals `end_actual - start_actual` and `<end>` equals the bucketed `end_actual`

#### Scenario: Windowed result mid-restart

- **WHEN** a pod was running at `start_actual` and replaced before `end_actual`
- **THEN** the reader emits both pod-info entries for the window (the prior and the current UID); see "Pod restart handling" requirement

### Requirement: Cluster-scoped IDs

The reader SHALL produce topology entities whose stable identifiers are cluster-scoped:

- Pod ID = `<cluster>/<pod-uid>` (composite of `cluster` and `uid` labels).
- K8s node ID = `<cluster>/<node>` (composite of `cluster` and `node` labels).
- PVC ID = `<cluster>/<namespace>/<claim_name>`.

#### Scenario: Two clusters with same node name

- **WHEN** `kube_node_info{cluster="cluster-alpha", node="worker-0"}` and `kube_node_info{cluster="cluster-beta", node="worker-0"}` both exist in the window
- **THEN** the reader emits two distinct K8s node entities with IDs `cluster-alpha/worker-0` and `cluster-beta/worker-0`

#### Scenario: Pod ID derives from uid label

- **WHEN** `kube_pod_info{cluster="cluster-alpha", uid="abc-123", ...}` is present
- **THEN** the reader emits a pod entity with ID `cluster-alpha/abc-123`

### Requirement: Canonical entity fields

Every emitted topology entity SHALL carry the four canonical fields consumed by the graph API: `id`, `name`, `type`, `labels`. The reader SHALL set these as follows:

- For pods: `name` = the `pod` label of `kube_pod_info`; `type` = `"pod"`; `labels` includes `cluster`, `namespace`, `node` (cluster-scoped node ID), and any K8s pod labels available from `kube_pod_labels` for that pod (added under their original keys).
- For K8s nodes: `name` = the `node` label of `kube_node_info`; `type` = `"node"`; `labels` includes `cluster`, `external_ip` when `kube_node_status_addresses{type="ExternalIP"}` provides one, and any node labels from `kube_node_labels` for that node (the `label_*=` series translates to entries under their original key with the `label_` prefix removed).
- For PVCs: `name` = the `claim_name` label of `kube_pod_spec_volumes_persistentvolumeclaims_info`; `type` = `"pvc"`; `labels` includes `cluster`, `namespace`, and `volume`.

#### Scenario: Pod entity canonical fields

- **WHEN** `kube_pod_info{cluster="cluster-alpha", namespace="shop", pod="checkout-1", uid="abc", node="worker-0"}` is present
- **THEN** the emitted pod entity has `id="cluster-alpha/abc"`, `name="checkout-1"`, `type="pod"`, `labels.cluster="cluster-alpha"`, `labels.namespace="shop"`, and `labels.node="cluster-alpha/worker-0"`

#### Scenario: K8s node external_ip surfaced under labels

- **WHEN** `kube_node_status_addresses{cluster="cluster-alpha", node="worker-0", type="ExternalIP", address="203.0.113.10"}` is present
- **THEN** the emitted K8s node entity has `labels.external_ip="203.0.113.10"`

#### Scenario: K8s node labels flattened

- **WHEN** the upstream provides `kube_node_labels{cluster="cluster-alpha", node="worker-0", label_topology_kubernetes_io_zone="us-east-1a", label_kubernetes_io_arch="amd64"}`
- **THEN** the emitted node entity's `labels` map contains `topology.kubernetes.io/zone="us-east-1a"` and `kubernetes.io/arch="amd64"` under their original keys

### Requirement: Pod restart handling within window

When `last_over_time(kube_pod_info[...])` returns multiple `uid` values for the same `(cluster, namespace, pod)` tuple within the requested window, the reader SHALL retain the entity with the latest evaluation timestamp as the canonical pod, retain the prior entity as a `replaced` pod, and emit a synthetic `pod-replaced-by` edge from the prior pod's ID to the latest pod's ID.

#### Scenario: Pod replaced mid-window

- **WHEN** the window includes a pod restart producing two distinct UIDs for the same pod name
- **THEN** the resulting topology contains two pod entities and a `pod-replaced-by` edge from the older UID's ID to the newer UID's ID

### Requirement: Cluster discovery query

The topology reader SHALL provide a discovery query, used by the cluster discovery endpoint, that returns the set of distinct `cluster` label values observed in `kube_node_info` over a configurable lookback (default 1 hour) via PromQL `group by (cluster) (last_over_time(kube_node_info[<lookback>]))`.

#### Scenario: Two clusters discovered

- **WHEN** centralised VictoriaMetrics holds `kube_node_info` series for `cluster=cluster-alpha` and `cluster=cluster-beta` within the discovery lookback
- **THEN** the discovery query returns exactly the set `{ "cluster-alpha", "cluster-beta" }`

### Requirement: Series missing the cluster label

A topology series that is missing the `cluster` label SHALL be bucketed under `cluster="unknown"`. The reader SHALL surface the count of such series via the `kube_state_graph_clusters_observed` gauge (the value `unknown` will appear in the gauge's label set when present).

#### Scenario: Legacy series without cluster label

- **WHEN** a `kube_pod_info` series has no `cluster` label
- **THEN** the resulting pod entity has `cluster: "unknown"` and contributes to the `unknown` value in the observed-clusters set

### Requirement: Allowlist enforcement

When the server is configured with `--clusters-allowlist`, every topology query SHALL inject `{cluster=~"a|b|c"}` (regex over the allowlist values) so series outside the allowlist are not fetched, parsed, or counted toward the cluster-size ceiling.

#### Scenario: Series outside allowlist excluded

- **WHEN** the server is started with `--clusters-allowlist=cluster-alpha` and centralised VictoriaMetrics also has data for `cluster-beta`
- **THEN** issued PromQL strings contain `cluster=~"cluster-alpha"` selectors and the resulting topology contains no entities with `cluster="cluster-beta"`

### Requirement: Bounded cluster-size probe

Before issuing the full set of topology queries, the reader SHALL run a single probe query `count(kube_pod_info{<allowlist-selector>}) @ <end>`. If the probe result exceeds `--max-pods` (default 5000), the reader SHALL abort the build with an error tagged `cluster_too_large`.

#### Scenario: Cluster too large

- **WHEN** the probe `count(kube_pod_info)` returns 12000 and `--max-pods` is 5000
- **THEN** the reader returns an error with code `cluster_too_large` and does not issue the remaining topology queries

### Requirement: Per-call upstream timeout

Each topology query SHALL be issued with a per-call context timeout (default 10 seconds, configurable). On timeout or non-2xx response, the reader SHALL increment `kube_state_graph_upstream_query_failures_total{query=<name>}` and propagate the error so the build aborts.

#### Scenario: Single query times out

- **WHEN** centralised VictoriaMetrics fails to respond to the `kube_node_labels` query within the per-call timeout
- **THEN** the failure counter for `query="kube_node_labels"` increments by 1 and the build returns an error
